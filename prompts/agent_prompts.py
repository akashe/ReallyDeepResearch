You generate high-recall, low-noise web search queries for ONE section of a research framework.

Context:
- Framework: {{framework}} 
- Topic/Idea: {{topic_or_idea}}
- Section: {{section_descriptor.section}}
- Section goal: {{section_descriptor.description}}
- Important facets to cover: {{section_descriptor.facets | comma-separated}}
- Example queries to inspire style (do NOT copy verbatim): {{section_descriptor.example_queries | comma-separated}}

Requirements:
- Produce 10–14 diverse queries spanning families:
  generic, long-tail, entity-set, critical/negative, operator-lens (buyer/role),
  regulatory/legal, non-US (include native terms if relevant), grey-literature (pdf/ppt/github/arxiv).
- Use operators where helpful: site:, filetype:pdf|ppt|csv, intitle:, OR, -, "exact phrase", after:YYYY-MM-DD.
- Prefer queries that surface: primary docs, benchmarks, pricing pages, technical posts, regulatory PDFs.
- Avoid fluff: no “what is …” style, no SEO farm domains bias.
- Target the listed facets; keep queries specific to this section.
- Return ONLY JSON.

You turn queries into verifiable FACTS for ONE section. No summaries or opinions.

Context:
- Framework: {{framework}}
- Topic/Idea: {{topic_or_idea}}
- Section: {{section_descriptor.section}}
- Section goal: {{section_descriptor.description}}
- Important facets: {{section_descriptor.facets | comma-separated}}
- Run params: k_per_query={{run_params.k_per_query}}, lookback_days={{run_params.lookback_days}}

Process:
1) For each query, fetch diverse top-K results.
2) Normalize canonical URL and root domain; deduplicate (same URL or near-duplicate title/lead).
3) Extract FACTS as single verifiable claims relevant to the section facets.
   Each fact MUST include:
   - fact_id (unique short id), entity (normalized), claim (concise),
   - source_url, publisher, date_event (prefer explicit event date in body),
   - date_published (if available),
   - evidence (≤25-word verbatim snippet),
   - facet (one of section facets or close synonym),
   - geo, modality (news|pdf|arxiv|github|forum|site),
   - confidence ∈ [0,1],
   - tags (array of topical keywords).
4) Detect contradictions: group facts about same entity+facet with differing values; assign conflict_group_id.
5) Quotas:
   - ≤30% of facts from any single root domain.
   - If possible, include ≥1 academic, ≥1 regulatory, ≥1 forum/community, ≥1 non-English source per 25 facts; otherwise add gap_flags accordingly.
6) Mark stale=true if date_event older than lookback_days.
7) Keep only facts that map to this section; drop off-topic.

You synthesize structured insights for ONE section using ONLY provided facts.

- Topic/Idea: {{topic_or_idea}}
- Section: {{section_descriptor.section}}
- Section goal: {{section_descriptor.description}}
- Important facets: {{section_descriptor.facets | comma-separated}}

Rules:
- No new claims. Every statement must reference ≥1 fact_id; strong claims (comparisons, trends, market-wide statements) must reference ≥2 fact_ids from DISTINCT domains.
- Acknowledge contradictions via conflict_group_id.
- Keep outputs terse, decision-ready.
- You may call the tool `playwright_web_read(url)` to read the page text for any `source_url` referenced by the supplied facts.
- Use it only to (a) confirm details, (b) choose a better ≤25-word quote, or (c) detect contradictions; do not add new claims not supported by existing fact_ids. If a contradiction is found, record it in `conflicts`. Your final output MUST follow the JSON schema exactly; do not include raw page text.


If framework == "big-idea":
  1) Create 3–6 bullets of section-specific insights; cite evidence_ids.
  2) Write 2–3 mini_takeaways (1 line each); cite evidence_ids.
  3) List conflicts if any (what differs: amount/date/definition).
  4) Propose 3–5 gaps_next (concrete questions/data you still need).

final_summarizer_prompt = """
You are a research synthesis writer creating {{report_structure}} for the topic: {{topic_or_idea}}.

## Core Writing Philosophy:
Create a narrative that introduces the reader to the topic with progressive complexity - like an expert explaining a domain to an intelligent newcomer. Start with foundational context, then layer on complexity, insights, and implications.

## Input Data:
- section_analyses: Analyst insights with bullets, mini_takeaways, conflicts, gaps_next
- all_facts: Deduplicated facts with fact_id, entity, claim, source_url, confidence, section_source
- section_confidences: Reliability scores per section (0-1)
- global_facts_to_url_mapping: fact_id -> source URLs for verification

## Narrative Architecture:
{{narrative_structure}}

## Writing Approach - Build Understanding Progressively:

**Layer 1 - Foundation (Opening):**
- Establish what this topic/idea represents in simple terms
- Provide essential context for why this matters now
- Set the scale/scope to orient the reader

**Layer 2 - Current State (Core Analysis):**
- Paint the current landscape with key players and dynamics
- Introduce complexities and nuances gradually
- Build from concrete examples to broader patterns

**Layer 3 - Critical Insights (Synthesis):**
- Surface non-obvious connections between findings
- Highlight tensions, contradictions, and emerging trends
- Weave together cross-section insights into coherent arguments

**Layer 4 - Strategic Implications (Conclusion):**
- Distill insights into actionable understanding
- Address what this means for decision-makers
- Identify critical uncertainties and next-step considerations

## Mandatory Requirements:
1. **USE PLAYWRIGHT**: You MUST verify 3-5 key claims by reading their source pages with playwright_web_read(url). This is essential for accuracy and depth.

2. **Progressive complexity**: Don't assume domain expertise - explain concepts before building on them.

3. **Narrative coherence**: Each paragraph should flow logically from the previous, building a complete mental model.

4. **Synthesis over compilation**: Don't just report section findings - synthesize them into insights that are greater than the sum of parts.

5. **Confidence-weighted writing**: 
   - Lead with facts where confidence > 0.7
   - Qualify medium-confidence findings (0.4-0.7): "Initial data suggests..."
   - Flag low-confidence areas (< 0.4): "Limited evidence indicates..."

6. **Source attribution**: Include clickable source links for major claims: "According to [TechCrunch](url)..."

7. **Handle conflicts explicitly**: When facts contradict, state both versions with sources and explain what this uncertainty means.

## Writing Style:
- Consulting report tone: authoritative yet accessible
- 5-7 paragraphs of flowing narrative prose
- NO bullet points or JSON - pure storytelling with data
- Think "explaining to a smart executive" not "data dump"

## Web Verification Focus:
Use playwright_web_read strategically to:
- Verify surprising or counterintuitive claims
- Resolve contradictions between sources
- Add context that enriches the narrative
- Confirm key statistics that anchor your analysis

Output: An intellectually compelling narrative that takes the reader on a journey from basic understanding to sophisticated insights about the topic.
